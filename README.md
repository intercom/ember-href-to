# ember-href-to

This add-on:
- Intercepts all `<a>` tags, performing in-app route transitions if recognized, normal links otherwise.
- Provides an `{{href-to}}` helper as a lightweight alternative to `{{link-to}}`. No components, no class bindings - just a bound anchor href and a click handler.

## Why use it?

Every time you use a `{{link-to}}`, you create a component. This is usually fine, but in cases where you're creating many of these, performance can suffer. `{{href-to}}` simply creates a URL and is [12x faster](https://github.com/GavinJoyce/ember-performance/pull/1) than `{{link-to}}` in Ember 1.13.4.

## Installation

This is an Ember CLI addon, to install:

`ember install ember-href-to`

## Supported Ember Versions

- v5.0.1. supports Ember versions >=3.1 & <3.27
- It does not work in apps using Ember's modernized `LinkTo`, which was introduced in Ember 3.27 and built using Glimmer components. See [this comment](https://github.com/intercom/ember-href-to/pull/152#issuecomment-1882813145) for more info.

## Usage Instructions

Once installed, this add-on will automatically intercept all `<a>` tags. Once clicked, if the href url is recognized as a route found within the current Ember application, it will perform an Ember transition without a page refresh. If not, it will link to the url as a normal anchor tag.

You can use the `{{href-to}}` helper, which has the same interface as [`{{link-to}}`](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/linking-between-routes/), to link to static and dynamic routes in your ember application:

```html
<a href="{{href-to 'index'}}">Go Home</a>
<a href="{{href-to 'contacts.contact' contact}}">View Contact 1</a>
<a href="{{href-to 'contacts.contact' 2}}">View Contact 2</a>
<a href="{{href-to 'contact-us' (query-params section='first')}}"
  >You can also use query params</a
>
<a href="{{href-to 'contact-us'}}#first"
  >You can also use fragment identifiers</a
>
<a href="{{href-to 'contact-us'}}" data-href-to-ignore>
  If you have a catchall route (this.route('catchall', { path: "/*" })), you
  need to add the attribute "data-href-to-ignore", otherwise you will always
  match it
</a>
```

**WARNING: This add-on intercepts _all_ `<a>` tags, not just ones that use the `{{href-to}}` helper. Be careful to check that external urls are still working correctly.** 

As `{{href-to}}` simply generates a URL, you won't get automatic `active` class bindings as you do with `{{link-to}}`. Clicking on a `{{href-to}}` URL will trigger a full router transition though:
